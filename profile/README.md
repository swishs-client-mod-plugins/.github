## [Kernel](https://github.com/kernel-mod/electron)
[Code Snippets](https://github.com/swishs-client-mod-plugins/code-snippets): A Discord package (eventually will be compatible with all kernel-compatible apps) that lets you add and manage custom JS, TS, JSX, CSS, and SCSS snippets via a built in editor (monaco).

## [Unbound](https://github.com/unbound-mod/)
[Reply Modifications](https://github.com/swishs-client-mod-plugins/reply-modifications):
Adds some more customization options to replies like forced and suppressed mentions for outgoing and incoming replies.

[Remove Message Cooldown](https://github.com/swishs-client-mod-plugins/remove-message-cooldown): Removes that annoying "Enter the chill zone" modal that pops up when you try to send more than 5 messages.

[Escape All Markdown](https://github.com/swishs-client-mod-plugins/escape-all-markdown): Adds a command to escape all markdown in a message.

## [Cumcord](https://github.com/Cumcord/Cumcord/)
[Sperm Bank](https://github.com/swishs-client-mod-plugins/sperm-bank): Lets you add discord messages to a personal "bank" of messages.

[Global Substitution](https://github.com/swishs-client-mod-plugins/cumcord-plugins/tree/main/plugins/global-substitution): Makes Discord's substitution feature not suck by making it replace every match instead of just the first one.
